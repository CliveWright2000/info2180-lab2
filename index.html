            <ol>
                <li><strong>Chicken Wings</strong> - For the most even-cooking, opt for chicken wings that have been broken down into drumettes (the ones that look like mini chicken legs) and wingettes (the oblong wing pieces). You can use full chicken wings, but they'll take a bit longer to cook and you'll need to trim off the wing tip.</li> 
                <li><strong>Avocado Oil or Olive Oil</strong> - Either high-quality avocado oil or olive oil are neutral enough and great for high-heat cooking. Avoid using canola or vegetable oil, as they don't have the best flavor for baking and are more common for deep-frying.</li> 
                <li><strong>Unsalted Butter</strong> - Opt for unsalted butter since you'll be using a salty, lemon pepper seasoning. Feel free to adjust the salt levels to taste as you wish though! </li>
                <li><strong>Lemon-Pepper Seasoning</strong> - Our favorites are Lawry's Lemon Pepper Seasoning or McCormick Lemon Pepper Seasoning if you need a solid recommendation.</li>
            </ol><p>
                To make lemon pepper wings: 
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Prepare the Chicken Wings</strong> - Preheat the oven to 400 degrees Farenheit. Pat the chicken wings dry with a paper towel, place them into a large bowl, and drizzle them with oil.</li>
                <li><strong>Assemble the Chicken Wings</strong> - Place on a baking sheet with a bit of space in between each one. Don't overcrowd the chicken wings, or else they won't have enough space to get crispy!</li>
                <li><strong>Bake the Chicken Wings</strong> - Bake for 40 minutes or until they turn golden brown and crispy.</li>
                <li><strong>Make the Lemon Pepper Butter Sauce</strong> - Melt the butter in a medium size bowl and stir in lemon pepper seasoning. Pour the sauce over the wings and toss until well-coated then serve.</li>

        <h2 class = "btitle">My 3 Study Tips</h2>
        <p class = "date">September 27, 2022 by Clive</p>

            <ul>
            <li><strong>Create a Study Schedule and Stick to It</strong> - Creating a study schedule allows students to maintain focus and manage their time well, especially for those who find it difficult to study regularly. When creating a study schedule, the student should keep their schoolwork and extracurriculars in mind. By being thoughtful about their schedule, they can choose times where they can relax, focus, and, most of all, study. This also comes with the added benefit of reduced stress outside study hours. Many students feel guilty when relaxing if they know they should study more often. However, when students delegate specific times of their day to study, they can rest easy during the rest of the day, knowing that they're doing what they can when they can.
            </li><br>
            <li><strong>Cut out Distractions</strong> - When planning to study, it's important to take note of the things to do, but the things that students should be avoiding are just as important. Many things can distract a student, making it incredibly difficult for them to focus. This prevents them from maximizing their scheduled study sessions. While regular breaks from studying are necessary, those breaks must be scheduled and timed. For example, a student can take five-minute breaks every 30 minutes. For a student to remain focused, they should cut out all possible distractions that might lure their attention away from studying. One way to do this is by avoiding using smartphones or other electronics. If theyâ€™re necessary for research purposes, turn off all notifications and avoid visiting websites that are not essential to the study session.
            </li><br>
            <li><strong>Take Practice Tests</strong> - Practice makes perfect, as they say. This is true for many things, including a student,s study habits. There may not be a better way to test how well a student has learned the information they're studying than by actually taking a practice test similar to the real thing.
                    By taking practice tests, students can determine which areas they need to improve on and learn more about. This ensures they can be prepared for the actual test and feel confident they'll get an outstanding grade.
